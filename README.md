# Javascript Tutorial

## Purpose

My colleague wants a quick overview of some of the popular libraries used by Javascript developers. I want to ensure I understand what I'm talking about.

This will be a demo application which will use Backbone, Underscore, Require, Highcharts, and jQuery. Eventually the project will allow you to display yearly stock prices and other financial data.


Maybe I'll learn something.
